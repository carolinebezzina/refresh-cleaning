            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
				<p>Since 2008 my company has been cleaning Data  Centres, computer rooms and offices in secure facilities. Firstly as a  contractor to a national I.T. cleaning company, we gained several years&rsquo;  valuable experience cleaning Data Centres, in Sydney,  Brisbane, Gold Coast and Queensland areas. </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>During that time we have done cleaning work in Commonwealth  Bank, Vodafone, Macquarie Bank, Virgin Blue, Network 10, Channel 7, Ernst and  Young, University and Government facilities, just to name a few. As a company  we are very aware of the critical nature and duty of care required for cleaning  the I.T. environment. </p>
